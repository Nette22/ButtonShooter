<h1> Button Shooter </h1>
<p>This Button Shooter game is an Andriod application in which the user presses a button and shoots. As of right now 
the user doesn't shoot anything yet but hopefully soon. This is a prime example for how all NeatoMosquito code
should be written, with good use of Java convnetions and proper use of comments.</p>


<h2> How to use </h2>
<p>This code can be forked easily using Egit with eclipse and you can run it from your home machine.</p>


<h2>Things that could make it more awesome </h2>
<p>As of right now the game is ready to go in it's bare state. Things that could be done to improve the overall
look and feel of the game include:</p>
1. Adding a better looking menu. (Right now the menu is a mere two buttons but we would like to add on others)
  1.1. Good new menu changes could be making the choices as TextViews instead of Buttons for better visuals.
    1.1.1. This should corespond with a making of a new background.
  1.2. Other things to add to the menu include a preferences sections or a settings menu.
  1.3. An About us section
2. Adding a splash screen when the app is first started.
  2.1. Put "loading..." at the bottom with a TextView so people think something is actually happening.
3. Making the game better
  3.1. Actually shoot something.
  3.2. Have a bullet or shot visible.


<p>This is stilla work in progress and any ideas or are welcome.</p>
